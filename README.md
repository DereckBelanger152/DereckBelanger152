<p>A little bit about me:  I am a 21 years old student in Computer Science at Laval University, located in Canada. My first language is French, but I am bilingual and speak/write/understand English perfectly. I have many passions such as Snowboarding (gotta take advantage of the cold winters somehow!), Golf, MMA and I absolutely love learning new things. My obsession right now is neuroscience which I have a project to open a non-professional website documenting my new-gained knowledge and share easy tips for increasing well-being and performance.

I am on my way to get Harvard's CS50x computer science certificate and their new Cybersecurity certificate. You will find below a list of the projects I've been working on through the certificate and my own ideas </p>
